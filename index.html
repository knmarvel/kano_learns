        <p>Someday soon, this will all look crazy cool. You'll ask me about CSS, and I'll be like, "Blah, blah, blah: exactly the right answer." But for now, have a list of links, hope they make you happy.</p>

                <li>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
                    <p>I love discovery! One of my favorite games to play is Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon on Wikipedia. The rules are:</p>
                    <ol>
                           <li> Go to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki.Special:Random">random article</a> on Wikipedia.</li>
                            <li>Find a link on the page is most likely to have information about Kevin Bacon.</li>
                            <li>Find a link on this new page that gets you even closer to information about Kevin Bacon</li>
                            <li>Repeat until a link you click is the Wikipedia page about Kevin Bacon. If you've gotten there in six or fewer clicks, you win the game!</li>
                            <li>You personally win regardless because you get to find out new information with each Wikipedia page, making you a more well-rounded person. Yay, you!</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Ready for this throwback to 2004? Can't live without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMkbjxvwur30YrFWw8kpSaw">Homestar Runner!</a> You can still find the <a href="https://www.homestarrunner.com">old site</a>, but as it runs on Flash, YouTube is more accesssible for Apple users.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> is a search engine that claims it doesn't sell or store your data. You still get ads, but not the same ads on every page. For instance, I searched for professional clothing with DuckDuckGo, and lingered a few moments on an awesome shirt. With Google, I would see that shirt on every page with Google ads for the next week. With DuckDuckGo, I don't see ads for that shirt anywhere.</li>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I've been in the broad field of office administration since 2012. I worked in a college financial aid office, as the office administrator of an aerospace corporation, and as business manager/interim director of a library. I realized a few things about my current career arc: <ol><li>I need a masters degree to move up as a librarian, which would cost up to  4 years salary of a highly contested library director job that I have no guarantee of attaining.</li> 
                <li>If I wanted to pursue business administration, again, highly contested field with low pay.</li>
                <li>If I wanted to specialize to get higher pay, I'd need a degree in accounting or business, which means a master's degree and then doing the job of solving the same types of problems over and over again.</li>
                <li>With my current skills, I am limited by my location. I need the ability to work remotely. </li></ol></p>
                <p>So I decided to do something completely different than what I had been doing before. I have spent over 200 hours of my life playing <a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine">Human Resource Machine</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/7billionhumans">7 Billion Humans</a>. I came across a few reviews from software engineers that said, "It seems silly to play a game exactly like my job," and I thought: "Oh, that's it. I could program for a living."</p> <p>In July of 2019, I embarked on a year of learning and creative exploration. One large part of that is <a href="Kenzie.Academy">Kenzie Academy</a>, a software engineering program that is more than a bootcamp. It's like a trade school for web design and software engineering, complete with an apprenticeship, that awards a certificate from Butler University and has a vested interest in ensuring that my skills make me highly employable. Another part of that is encouraging myself to have artistic freedom and to share my creations.</p>
